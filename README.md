# rtlwifi_rtl8723de
Add rtl8723de support to rtlwifi driver

This is a trial version of rtl8723de driver based on the rtlwifi in linux kernel that<br>
means it supports all chips existed in rtlwifi, and it will submit to kernel recently. <br>
Due to development progress, rtl8822be is also included.

We maintain kernel version statements to support older kernel but not guarantee to<br>
all versions.

Installation:
> $ make<br>
> $ sudo make install<br>
> $ reboot<br>
